THIS IS YOUR USER INTERFACE.
AS ENEMIES ENTER FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE GAMEPLAY AREA, YOU MUST KEEP RODELLE ALIVE THROUGHOUT THE SIEGE. HIS HEALTH IS DISPLAYED AT ALL TIMES ABOVE HIS HEAD AND ON THE CONTROL PANEL.
IN THE GAMEPLAY AREA, LEFT-CLICK ON THE SPAWN STRUCTURE TO SELECT WHICH TROOP TYPE YOU WOULD LIKE TO DEPLOY. SPAWN STRUCTURES AND TROOP TYPES MATCH IN COLOR.
WHEN A SPAWN STRUCTURE IS SELECTED, LEFT-CLICK AGAIN TO PLACE A BASIC MARKER FOR ALL TROOPS OF THE RESPECTIVE TYPE. TROOPS HEADING TOWARDS BASIC MARKERS WILL ATTACK ENEMIES ALONG THE WAY.
LEFT-CLICKING ON A PLACED BASIC MARKER WILL TURN IT INTO A COMMAND MARKER FOR ALL TROOPS OF THE RESPECTIVE TYPE. TROOPS HEADING TOWARDS COMMAND MARKERS WILL IGNORE ENEMIES ALONG THE WAY.
LEFT-CLICKING ON A SINGLE TROOP WILL SELECT ITS SQUAD. LEFT-CLICK ONCE TO DEPLOY THE SQUAD. DOUBLE-CLICKING WITH THE LEFT-MOUSE BUTTON WILL FORCE COMMAND THE SQUAD TO THE TARGET DESTINATION.
IF RODELLE OR A SPAWN STRUCTURE IS DAMAGED, CLICK ON THE HEAL STRUCTURE AND SELECT WHOSE HEALTH YOU WISH TO RECOVER. THERE IS A WAIT TIME BETWEEN EACH HEAL, THOUGH, SO MONITOR THE COOLDOWN BAR CLOSELY!
ALSO KEEP WATCH OF THE DIALOGUE BOX FOR HELPFUL NOTIFICATIONS FROM RODELLE AND THE TROOPS.
ENEMIES CAN TAKE OVER A SPAWN STRUCTURE BY REDUCING ITS HEALTH TO ZERO. THEN, YOU LOSE SOME CONTROL OF THE RESPECTIVE TROOPS AND THEY ARE ABLE TO UPGRADE THEIR ATTACKS WITH WEAPONS. RECLAIM THE STRUCTURE BY ATTACKING IT BACK!
DEFEATING ENEMIES WILL LEVEL UP YOUR TROOPS AND GIVE YOU GOLD FOR PURCHASING STRUCTURE UPGRADES LATER. THE MORE YOU USE A CERTAIN TROOP TYPE, THE FASTER IT LEVELS UP! COMPLETING LEVELS UNLOCKS NEW STRUCTURES FOR TROOPS AND ABILITIES.
THE WAVE COUNTER SHOWS YOU HOW MANY GROUPS OF ENEMIES WILL BE ENTERING THE MAP. WHEN THE COUNTER REACHES ZERO AND ALL ENEMIES IN THE MAP ARE ELIMINATED, YOU WIN THE BATTLE!
